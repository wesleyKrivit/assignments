**CMSI 2021** Web Application Development, Fall 2023

# Assignment 1005
This assignment aims to level you up in multiple ways:
* Creating and deploying a React web application
* Fetching and displaying data from a public API
* Writing asynchronous code in JavaScript

We aren’t vanilla anymore 🍦

## Background/Preparatory Reading
* Read whatever [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) you might need—take note when web searching, because React has moved their documentation to a new site (see that link). It may take a while for the new location to propagate through search engines
* Review Dr. Toal’s course notes on React and web service APIs. Follow any links in the notes that interest you
* Take Eve Porcello’s React Essentials class on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-essential-training-14836121) (access it via [MYLMU](https://my.lmu.edu))
* For even moar learning, go through The Net Ninja’s [Full Modern React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d)
* To solidify your Git abilities, read from the beginning through Chapters 3, and Chapters 5 and 6 of the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)—if you haven’t already done so, you can acquire a practice repository with _README.md_ at [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/Xu9oeBgm) (you can always create a free one of course)

## For Submission
Create an interactive React web application that fetches data from an API and displays that data in a way that’s appropriate for the application. Be creative, but also work toward developing an application that would actually be useful. You can use any API that you find: it can be for music, food, restaurants, museums, weather, you name it.

Need some API ideas? API lists abound. Try [this one](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/), [this one](https://apilist.fun/), [this one](https://www.postman.com/explore/apis-for-beginners) or (especially) [this one](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

First and foremost, you must have a functional and sufficiently bug-free app:
* Effective and/or interesting API use—Don’t just call an API for calling’s sake; envision a potentially useful application for it
* Present the API’s data well—Avoid excessive plain text…structure, stylize, and highlight the information well
* Let your user have a say—Provide at least one use case where the API request is based on user input (e.g., search term? menu choice? settings?)

Next, your app should look great outside _and_ inside (i.e., for fellow developers):
* Abstraction of network operations—Declare all network operations as asynchronous functions, with the rest of the code calling those functions. i.e., The only place that `fetch` should be called is within functions that are exported by a pure JavaScript (non-React) module—components should call those functions instead of calling `fetch` on their own
* Clean console log—Watch out for HTML validation and accessibility warnings, or other warnings/errors from React! (_Hint:_ There shouldn’t be any—and if there are, fix them)

In addition to the app working correctly, the web app layout must demonstrate these characteristics:
* Responsiveness—The site must look good on mobile and web (narrow or wide screen)
* Site balance and aesthetics—Use colors and contrast properly! Line things up! We aren’t expected to be visual artists, but we can strive to present information in a way that is clear and usable. Optionally, get a designer friend of yours to critique your work
* Appropriate user interface feedback—The web app should provide visible indicators when it is waiting for asynchronous operations to finish
* Graceful error handling—No unexpected freezes nor stack traces please

As in the first assignment, to attain the aforementioned qualities, the following are required—_all_ of them, or no credit will be awarded (as one goal of this assignment is to get you to actually use a large amount of HTML and CSS):

* A background image or gradient
* A non-standard font (show that you can import a font from Google Fonts or similar)
* Grid layout for one or more components
* Flex layout for one or more components
* A nice title (perhaps an `h1` element, with matching CSS)
* A fun image or two
* At least one transition

Because apps may vary widely at this point, these CSS properties are not required but keep them in your radar in case your particular app can use them:
* `border`
* `border-radius`
* `box-shadow`
* `margin`
* `padding`
* `position` (particularly `position: absolute` or `position: sticky`)
* `transform`
* `text-shadow`
You’re right, we haven’t seen all of these in class—but they can be looked up!

Deploy the app to any location where it can be accessed on the web at large. There are ways to do this with both [Replit](https://replit.com) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), among other places ([Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), etc.). Your choice.

Finally, supply a simple _about.md_ Markdown file that describes your app briefly. Include a brief description of the API that you have chosen, including a link to its documentation. Highlight anything about the app that you think is particularly interesting or that you’re particularly proud of. Supply the link to where the app is deployed.

As always, your code (all files) must be flawlessly formatted, and that means that you not only indent and space 100% consistently, but that you are also perfectly consistent with blank-line spacing where necessary. Prettier will help with most things if you format locally in your editor; your chosen environment may have an auto-format feature as well. Activate “format-on-save” if your editor has it, so you don’t have to ever worry about formatting while working.

## Operational Tips/Suggestions
* Although there is no particular mandated approach toward building API-backed apps, you won’t go wrong with this approach:
    * Start by studying the API. Get to know its features. _Communicate with it directly_ using the [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com), _curl_, or similar utilities. Talk to it until you feel that you know it well
    * Make strategic use of temporary `console.log` statements to confirm that information is flowing as expected, before proceeding further with building out user interface elements
* Remember that there isn’t enough class time to cover absolutely everything that you might want to do! We hope that our class time so far has served to give you a good foundation for getting started, but definitely don’t let “this wasn’t mentioned in class” be a barrier when it comes to figuring things out
* Get increasingly better at doing targeted searches on the web. Prepend `MDN` or `react.dev` to scope the search to well-known sources. State the technology (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `JSX`, `hook`, etc.) to scope things even further
* Note the timing! Now that you have done the first app, you have a clearer idea of how long it takes to put something like this together. _Schedule your work accordingly._ It’s fair to say that for this app, you will take roughly the same amount of time to code up the app itself, but now you also have to factor in:
    1. The time it takes to choose and learn your API
    2. The time it takes to implement network functions
    3. Additional state/logic for showing progress feedback and handling errors

    So make sure to plan accordingly! The due date may seem far away, but it’s scheduled there for a reason 🧐
* Note that you will not have your Github Classroom repositories right away; make use of the time beforehand to do some self-study and individual exploration. That way, when you do get to the official repository, you can hit the ground running!

## How to Turn it In
In your designated GitHub Classroom-supplied repository:
* Commit your code at regular intervals; the app should run directly from a `git clone` followed by `npm install` and `npm start`, with no further intervention
* Commit your _about.md_ file to this repository as well

Note that websites with lingering code errors will negatively affect other criteria, because if we can’t run your code, we can’t evaluate related remaining items completely.
